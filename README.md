# 2020-September-30ish-Swift-Projects
The projects done as the "September 30 Day Project" of Deep Fried Neurons 2020.
I had to take a short break to attend a virtual conference in the middle, so
I'm including some of the scratch pads to fill out the set. The code here in is
uncommented, undocumented, has no tests and is not refactored.

It's a swamp.

Wear bug spray.
